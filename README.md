# Bessel_Neural_Network-SplineRegression
Use bessel function as an activation function in a neural network and get similar results to other state of the art activation functions. Also address over-fitting problem in a neural network
<br/>
Run bessel_image.ipynb file in Deep Neural network folder to use bessel neural network
